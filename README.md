**Feature Branches**: When creating a branch for a new feature, use a name that describes the feature. For example, feature/user-authentication.

**Bugfix** Branches: If you're fixing a specific bug, name the branch accordingly, like bugfix/issue-123.

**Release** Branches: For release branches, use a format like release/1.0.0.

Hotfix Branches: When dealing with hotfixes, consider names like hotfix/issue-456.

Prefixes: Using prefixes like feature/, bugfix/, release/, and hotfix/ can help categorize and distinguish the type of branch.
